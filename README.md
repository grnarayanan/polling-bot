## Overview

Often times, reaching a consensus can be difficult without an organized method in place, and so this polling bot can be added to a Discord
server to solve that need in a simple and efficient manner. Use cases could include deciding with friends on a place to eat, what video game 
should be played, when to schedule a party, etc. 

The bot supports starting a poll and adding options for choices by the users. It will then keep track of responses made to the poll,
allow users to change their response, and surface the winner of the poll when called upon.
